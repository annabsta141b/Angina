# Angina

The goal of this project is to build a model that can help medical doctors accurately predict angina in the general population, using only the most significant variables. It is important that the model works well with as few predictive variables as possible because angina is a type of chest pain resulting from reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which is an emergency. During medical emergencies, doctorsâ€™ ability to gather patient information and access to patient medical history is limited.
